            <h1>Eiffel Tower</h1>
            <p>
                The Eiffel Tower is 324 meters tall, about the same height 
                as an 81-storey building. The tower has three levels for visitors,
                 with restaurants on the first and second floor. The third level is 
                 a platform, itâ€™s 276 meters above the ground. If you walk around Paris
                  in the evening you can enjoy a wonderful view of the lighted
                   Eiffel Tower.
                 And at some particular moment you can see the lights blinking.
            </p>

                I also want to visit the Eiffel Tower as it is one of the most
                 well-known attractions in the world
